# SmartOps Insight – Machine Condition Monitoring & Failure Prediction

SmartOps Insight is a real-time machine health monitoring system designed for factories and industries to continuously track the condition of their running machines. Using sensor data, the system predicts potential machine failures and helps in proactive maintenance to ensure efficient operations.

##  Features

-  **Real-time machine health prediction** using key parameters:
  - Temperature 
  - Pressure 
  - Vibration 
  - Humidity 
  - Power Consumption 
  - Hour of Day 
-  Interactive web interface built with **Python Flask** and **Tailwind CSS**
-  Simple input fields to feed data and check machine health instantly
-  Failure probability visualization with status indicators (Good, Warning, Bad )

##  Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning:** Random Forest algorithm
- **Frontend:** HTML + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Python Flask
- **Environment:** Google Colab (for training ML model)
- **Dataset:** Kaggle dataset

## How It Works

1. Collect real-time sensor data from machines in a factory or industrial environment
2. Input the sensor data into the web form
3. The system predicts the health status of the machine using the trained Random Forest model
4. The web interface displays the machine's health status along with failure probability
5. Factories can use this information for proactive maintenance to avoid unexpected downtimes

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Flask
- Required Python packages (see requirements.txt)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
